 Life is not a matter of holding good cards, but sometimes playing a poor hand well. Jack London

This is a simple version of a high low game that was built to follow these specifications:
The player starts the game with 300 points.
Individual cards are represented as a number from 1 to 13.
The current card is displayed.
The player guesses if the next one will be higher or lower.
The the next card is displayed.
The player earns 100 points if they guessed correctly.
The player loses 75 points if they guessed incorrectly.
If a player reaches 0 points the game is over.
If a player has more than 0 points they decide if they want to keep playing.
If a player decides not to play again, the player has to respond No by pressing "N" and the game is over.
Must have two classes

It is written using Python 3

The code works, but it does not account for when a user has an invalid input. This is just a basic game code, some enhancement are still needed to make it standard.
